5. Setup DNS and create a CNAME Record (www)as a Subdomain using my own Domain - [luckyowee.com.br](https://luckyowee.com.br/)

12. The day after the successfull instalation and login I tried to access again and had some technical issues on AWS side and the server became unreachable so I can't perform API Endpoint tests as requested on the assesment. :-(
